# Blender Weapon Texture Render Pipeline - Requirements
# 
# Most dependencies are built into Blender and don't need separate installation.
# This file is primarily for documentation purposes.

# Core Requirements (Built into Blender)
# =====================================
# Python 3.11+ (included with Blender 4.1.1)
# bpy (Blender Python API - built into Blender)
# mathutils (included with Blender)

# Standard Library Dependencies (Built into Python)
# ================================================
# os - for file system operations
# math - for mathematical operations  
# gc - for garbage collection and memory management

# External Software Requirements
# ==============================
# Blender 4.1.1+ (https://www.blender.org/download/)
# NVIDIA GPU with OptiX support (recommended for best performance)
# CUDA drivers (for GPU rendering)

# Optional Development Dependencies
# ================================
# If you want to contribute to development, you may want:
# flake8>=6.0.0          # Code linting
# black>=23.0.0          # Code formatting
# pytest>=7.0.0          # Testing framework

# System Requirements
# ==================
# Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
# 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended for large batch jobs)
# 2GB+ GPU memory (more for higher resolution renders)
# SSD storage (recommended for faster texture loading)

# Installation Notes
# ==================
# 1. Install Blender 4.1.1 or higher
# 2. Ensure NVIDIA drivers are up to date (for OptiX support)
# 3. No pip install required - all dependencies are built into Blender
# 4. Simply run the script within Blender or via command line

# For Command Line Usage
# ======================
# blender scene.blend --background --python pngandmask_export.py
